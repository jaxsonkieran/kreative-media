# KreativeMedia - Photography & Content Creation Website

Project milestone 1 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: HTML/CSS Essentials

This is a Front End Website for my business in sports photography and social media content creation, called KreativeMedia. It's a website built to showcase my portfolio of work and attract new clients. (these are all my own images, so therefore do not need any credits). This website is built on four pages, a home, an about page, a work page and a contact page. Along the footer you will find links to contact via mobile/email and social media. It is built only using HTML and CSS languages as per project guidelines.

## User Experience - UX Design Process
### Users
* Commercial Brands (Sport or Other)
* Local Businesses (Running Shops/Triathlon Shops/Sportswear companies)
* Sports Clubs (that may need photography for their event)
* Professional Athletes - looking for brand/product shots
* Other agencies that may require photography or video work 

### Analysis - What are the User's Needs?
* The users have been identified in the area of sport/commercial. They require product shots, event photography/videography, social media content creation, athlete/brand promotion, etc.  
* Social Media is growing quicker than most of us can comprehend. More and more brands/athletes/sports clubs/companies, etc. are utilising social media. 
* In order for a company/brand/athlete to gather a large following, and therefore sell more products/membership/get more entries to their events, etc. their content needs to be engaging and Professional.
* KreativeMedia is there to provide a solution in offering professional photography, videography and social media content creation for these users. 

### Design 
#### Website Structure
* KreativeMedia is a four page website consisting of the Home page, About page, Work page, and a contact form page. The Home page has four sections, an introduction (photo of the photographer and a small blurb) this section includes a button which will take the user to a page that includes more about me and the work that I do, a small list of some of the clients I've worked with in the past (client-info), a selection of my work (photography) this section also includes a button which will take the user to view the rest of my portfolio, the final section is a footer which includes contact details, and links to my social media. The Work page includes more of my work in photography and videography. The About Page includes four sections, a banner image, a section on services I offer, a grid on how the process works from ideation to creation to launch and a footer. The contact page has the nav bar at the top and the contact form, plus the footer that is standard across all pages. The navbar is also standard across all pages. 

### Colour Scheme of the Website
<br>

These colours were choosen using the website [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) which allow you to view trending colour palettes across the web, it's also a useful tool to view your colour palette and how it will look on a webpage!

### Typography
I wanted a clean minimalist typography for the website, so I imported 'Lato' from Google fonts in various weights, the sans-serif is used as a backup.

### Imagery
*The imagery used on this website is from my own personal bank of content that I have taken. If required I will use [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) to get royalty free imagery, but at this time there is no requirement. 

### Videos
* I wanted to include videos on my website but found it very difficult to ensure they were responsive on all devices without uploading the video into the website itself. I know it's better hosted online somewhere as it reduces the memory and will also help with speed. This led me to do a lot of research on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) which then led me to this responsive iframes article build through CSS which guided me through the process of making my videos responsive on all devices, credit Ben Marshall [Ben Marshall Responsive iframes](https://benmarshall.me/responsive-iframes/).

### Google Maps
*This website has a Google Maps location so users can locate my office/studio if needed. 

### Interactive Links
*At the bottom of the Landing Page and footer, users can access the company social media links (Facebook and Instagram). Once these icons are clicked they are opened in a new tab.


## Features
### Home Page / Landing page
* This is the first page a user will see if they click the main url to view my site. This page was created to be very visual but also to give small snippets about the person so that they can read and eventually go on to explore the rest of the website.
