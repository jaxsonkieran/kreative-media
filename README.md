### KreativeMedia - Photography & Content Creation Website

Project milestone 1 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: HTML/CSS Essentials

This is a Front End Website for my "business" in sports photography and social media content creation, called KreativeMedia. It's a website built to showcase my portfolio of work and attract new clients. (these are all my own images, so therefore do not need any credits). This website is built on three pages, a home, portfolio and contact page. Along the footer you will find links to contact via mobile/email and social media.
