# KreativeMedia - Photography & Content Creation Website

Project milestone 1 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: HTML/CSS Essentials

This is a Front End Website for my "business" in sports photography and social media content creation, called KreativeMedia. It's a website built to showcase my portfolio of work and attract new clients. (these are all my own images, so therefore do not need any credits). This website is built on three pages, a home, portfolio and contact page. Along the footer you will find links to contact via mobile/email and social media.

### Analysis - What are the User's Needs?
* The users have been identified in the area of sport/commercial. They require product shots, event photography/videography, social media content creation, athlete/brand promotion, etc.  
* Social Media is growing quicker than most of us can comprehend. More and more brands/athletes/sports clubs/companies, etc. are utilising social media. 
* In order for a company/brand/athlete to gather a large following, and therefore sell more products/membership/get more entries to their events, etc. their content needs to be engaging and Professional.

### Design 
#### Website Structure
* KreativeMedia is a four page website consisting of the Home page, About page, Work page, and a contact form page. The Home page has four sections, an introduction (photo of the photographer and a small blurb) this section includes a button which will take the user to a page that includes more about me and the work that I do, a small list of some of the clients I've worked with in the past (client-info), a selection of my work (photography) this section also includes a button which will take the user to view the rest of my portfolio, the final section is a footer which includes contact details, and links to my social media. The Work page includes more of my work in photography and videography. The About Page includes four sections, a banner image, a section on services I offer, a grid on how the process works from ideation to creation to launch and a footer. The contact page has the nav bar at the top and the contact form, plus the footer that is standard across all pages. The navbar is also standard across all pages. 

### Colour Scheme of the Website

These colours were choosen using the website [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) which allow you to view trending colour palettes across the web, it's also a useful tool to view your colour palette and how it will look on a webpage!

### Typography
I wanted a clean minimalist typography for the website, so I imported 'Mulish' from Google fonts in various weights, the sans-serif is used as a backup.
